# Compliance Framework Table and Mapping Matrix – Overview

This document outlines the structure, purpose, and usage of the **Compliance Framework Table and Mapping Matrix** tools within this reference folder, which are designed to help technical teams align, interpret, and plan quality system practices across multiple regulatory frameworks.

These tools serve as modular reference scaffolds that support ISO-to-GMP translation, audit readiness planning, and cross-functional alignment in regulated manufacturing environments. They are intended to act as starting points for internal customization, not turnkey solutions.

Once reviewed and approved by internal QA, regulatory, or compliance leads, these resources can serve as live references to help guide documentation system design, project scoping, or ownership mapping.

## What's Included

### 1. `compliance_clause_breakdown_table_v1_20250621.xlsx`
A clause-level, filterable table that maps quality system requirements across five major frameworks:

- GMP/cGMP (21 CFR 210/211)
- ISO 9001
- ISO 13485
- 21 CFR 820
- ICH Q10

**Key features:**
- Each row corresponds to a specific clause
- Includes QMS category, QMS theme, team function(s), implementation examples
- Filterable by framework, ownership, or theme for internal planning or gap analysis

**Use case:**  
Ideal for teams preparing for a specific audit, assigning quality responsibilities, or evaluating SOP coverage relative to external standards.

### 2. `cross-framework_mapping_matrix_v1_20250621.xlsx`
A high-level, category-to-framework matrix showing which QMS categories are addressed by which frameworks, along with example implementation strategies.

**Key features:**
- Rows = QMS categories (e.g., Document Control, Process Validation)
- Columns = Regulatory frameworks
- Cell contents = Implementation examples where a framework addresses a given category
- Blank cells highlight absence of direct coverage

**Use case:**  
Supports system design efforts, helps identify gaps when transitioning from ISO to GMP, and clarifies which QMS elements are universally covered vs. selectively covered.

---

## How These Tools Work Together

Start with the **cross-framework matrix** to understand overall system coverage and overlap.  
Then use the **clause breakdown table** to drill into specific requirements, delegate responsibilities, or align toolkit assets.

Together, they support:
- Cross-functional quality planning
- Internal system maturity assessments
- Documentation strategy setup
- Role-specific compliance awareness

## Who This Is / Isn’t For

**This resource is for:**
- Engineers and QA-adjacent teams supporting QMS buildout or evaluation
- Staff-level leads aligning ISO 9001 practices with GMP-readiness efforts
- System integrators needing structured references for compliance alignment

**It is not intended for:**
- Legal or certification use without internal QA review
- Direct copy/paste into audit-ready systems
- Use as a complete clause database without validation

## Authorship and Maintenance

This matrix toolkit was created by Josh Villanueva as part of the `quality-compliance-starter-kit` repository. It is structured to help translate ISO-based manufacturing experience to GMP-aligned environments and support cross-functional QMS development. 

Each file is modular, editable, and designed to evolve with team needs. They are intended to become internal references once vetted and customized by your organization’s quality system leadership.
