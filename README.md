# Quality Compliance Starter Kit

This repository provides a modular, system-oriented toolkit for standing up or evaluating compliance-aligned quality operations in regulated or production manufacturing environments. It is designed for engineering, MSAT, and QA-adjacent teams building, refactoring, or assessing Quality Management Systems (QMS) across:

- Biotech or pharmaceutical manufacturing (GMP, cGMP, 21 CFR 210/211)
- Medical device development (ISO 13485, 21 CFR 820)
- Semiconductor or hardware production (ISO 9001, IATF-like systems)
- Tech teams preparing for ISO/FDA hybrid readiness (e.g., IEC 62304, ICH Q10)

---

## Use Case

This kit supports organizations that need to:

- Bootstrap or re-structure a scalable, audit-aligned QMS  
- Conduct gap analysis against ISO or GMP standards  
- Align engineering documentation with QA expectations  
- Plan for ownership mapping, audit traceability, or training setup  
- Cross-walk between ISO 9001 and FDA-regulated environments

## How to Use

Clone or fork this repo into an internal system setup environment. From there, teams can:

- Tailor SOP templates to reflect product-specific or process-specific procedures  
- Populate trackers with site-level ownership, audit schedules, or training goals  
- Extend theme categories to match internal compliance pillars  
- Map documentation systems to external standards for audit prep

This kit is most useful when paired with team-level review and QA oversight.

## Who This Is / Isnâ€™t For

**This starter kit is for:**
- Engineering, MSAT, or ops teams supporting QMS setup or audit readiness  
- QA-adjacent groups aligning legacy systems with updated frameworks
