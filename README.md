# Quality Compliance Starter Kit

This repository provides a modular, system-oriented toolkit for standing up or evaluating compliance-aligned quality operations in regulated or production manufacturing environments. It is designed for use by engineering, MSAT, QA-adjacent, and systems integration teams working in:

- Biotech or pharmaceutical manufacturing (GMP, cGMP)
- Semiconductor or hardware operations (ISO 9001, IATF-like systems)
- Tech product teams preparing for regulatory scaling (e.g., FDA Class I/II, IEC 62304)

---

## Use Case

This kit is ideal for teams that need to:

- Rapidly prototype or refactor a fit-for-purpose QMS
- Prepare for internal, partner, or regulatory audits
- Conduct structured gap analysis on existing documentation or traceability systems
- Align engineering documentation systems with real-world compliance expectations

## Folder Structure

```
/templates/        → SOPs, quality manuals, audit logs
/trackers/         → Timelines, checklists, change logs
/reference/        → Regulatory mapping, glossary, source material
/diagrams/         → Optional visual system maps
```

## Components

| Folder      | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `/templates/` | Reusable operational documents (SOPs, audit logs, manual outline) |
| `/trackers/`  | Editable tools for change control, audits, and rollout planning |
| `/reference/` | Regulatory crosswalks for ISO 9001, 21 CFR, ICH Q10 |
| `/diagrams/`  | (Optional) Visual maps of QMS system elements |

## How to Use

This kit is meant to be cloned, forked, or copied into an internal tooling repo. From there, teams can:

- Populate templates with company-specific workflows
- Modify trackers to reflect internal audit cadence
- Extend the kit with org-specific folders (e.g., `/training/`, `/deviations/`, etc.)
- Track changes over time using Git or internal version control

---

## Disclaimers

- This kit is not a legal or regulatory authority
- Final system responsibility lies with designated QA or RA professionals
- This starter kit is intended to accelerate structured team planning, not replace formal compliance ownership

---

## Roadmap

Planned additions include:

- GMP-focused extension modules
- Semiconductor ISO audit checklist refinements
- Training matrix templates
- Configurable system scope planner
